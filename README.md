# SudokuTextSolver
This Python program will complete a Sudoku board using a backtracking algorithm
# Why I did this project
This small project was completed to help me regain some knowledge in the Python programming knowledge since I have not used Python since Grade 10 highschool
I will now use this knowledge and create a GUI version of this same program
