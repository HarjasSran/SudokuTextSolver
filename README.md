# Sudoku solver using python
After not using Python since Grade 10 in highschool, I am now trying to refresh my memory while creatiing a Sudoku solver with an inputted board with 0s in place for a blank spot.
# How does it work
Using a backtracking algorithm, my Python program is able to solve a Sudoku board with ease. All you gotta do is hit run!
